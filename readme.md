I created a tic tac toe game for my first General Assembly project. I implemented Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

The game allows users to enter their names and play until someone has made a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row, at which point the computer will announce either who has won or if a draw has occurred.
